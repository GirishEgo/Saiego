When the temperature drops below a set level, the thermostat activates the heater to warm up the area. Once the desired temperature is reached, it switches the heater off, helping maintain a stable and comfortable environment. This not only ensures energy efficiency, but also protects sensitive equipment from condensation, frost, or overheating. These thermostats are commonly used in electrical enclosures, switchgear panels, and control cabinets to keep everything working smoothly and safely.",

        description: "The pressure compensation plug is an essential component designed to safeguard sensitive electrical and electronic enclosures. It effectively regulates internal pressure caused by temperature fluctuations, ensuring that components remain protected from potential damage. By allowing air to flow freely while blocking external contaminants, the plug prevents the ingress of dust, humidity, and water, thereby maintaining a clean and dry internal environment. This is particularly important in harsh or outdoor conditions, where equipment is exposed to extreme weather elements. The plug also helps in avoiding condensation buildup, enhancing the lifespan and reliability of the components inside the enclosure.",
